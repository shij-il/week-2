## 📚 Topics Covered

The following JavaScript concepts were learned and used:

* `var`, `let`, `const`
* Data Types (Number, String)
* Operators (Arithmetic & Comparison)
* Conditional Statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
* Loops (`for`, `while`)
* Functions

## 🧠 Coding Tasks

### 1️⃣ Program to Find the Largest of Three Numbers

**Description:**
This program takes three numbers as input and determines the largest among them using conditional statements.

**Concepts Used:**

* Variables (`let`)
* Comparison operators
* `if-else` conditions
* Functions

**Sample Input:**

```
A = 10
B = 25
C = 15
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Largest number is: 25
```

### 2️⃣ Table Generator (Using Loops)

**Description:**
This program generates a multiplication table for a given number using loops.

**Concepts Used:**

* Variables
* `for` loop
* Arithmetic operators
* Functions

**Sample Input:**

```
Number = 5
```

**Sample Output:**

```
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
5 x 6 = 30
5 x 7 = 35
5 x 8 = 40
5 x 9 = 45
5 x 10 = 50
```

## ✅ Learning Outcome

By completing these tasks, I gained hands-on experience with JavaScript basics such as variables, conditions, loops, and functions. This helped strengthen my understanding of program logic and control flow.
