# 🔢 Counter App – Bootstrap Styled (Day 6)

This project is part of my **Weekly JavaScript Learning Workout – Day 6**, where I improved a previously built **Counter App** by enhancing its **UI using Bootstrap**, while keeping the **JavaScript DOM logic unchanged**.

The goal of this task was to understand how **Bootstrap can be used to improve design and responsiveness without rewriting JavaScript functionality**.

---

##  Project Overview

The **Counter App** allows users to:
- Increment the counter
- Decrement the counter
- Reset the counter to zero

The application dynamically updates the UI using **JavaScript DOM manipulation**, and the interface is styled using **Bootstrap components and utility classes**.
