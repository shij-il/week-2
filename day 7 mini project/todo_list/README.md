# 📝 JavaScript To-Do App (Mini Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **JavaScript Mini To-Do Application** developed as part of my **weekly JavaScript learning workout (Day 7 – Final Mini Project)**.  
It demonstrates practical usage of **JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, arrays, and objects**, along with UI enhancement using **Bootstrap**.

The application allows users to manage daily tasks efficiently with features like adding, editing, deleting, completing tasks, filtering, and theme switching.
